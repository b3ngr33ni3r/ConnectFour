So, the counter in the IsGameover() path checker isn't functioning correctly,
though, the rest does.


the IsGameover() can't handle if u do the following:
                                0 _ 0 0
                                then
                                0 0 0 0
because it takes two opposite directions to complete it


also it appears something is wrong with the directions in general. they don't work all the time.
